## Introduction
This project is a chat application built using React.js for the client-side interface and GetStream.io APIs for real-time messaging functionalities. The project is divided into two main components: the client-side application and the server-side application.

## Client

The client-side of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This part of the project handles the user interface, interactions, and communication with the server-side via RESTful APIs provided by GetStream.io.

## Server
The server-side of the application is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. This part of the project handles backend operations such as user authentication, message storage, and communication with the GetStream.io APIs.
